'''
Key Insights:
    - We can use a simple comparison of this index vs. last index
      instead of using a set. Additional notes in comments above each
      solution.

# This way uses a set in each stack frame to avoid doing duplicate
# combination generations. I.e. if this value is in the `seen` set, we
# should skip it. This was the more obvious/intuitive way I first saw to
# solve the problem.

# Effectively same solution as above, but with memory-saving
# optimization avoiding allocation a set in each stack frame. Intead, we
# just compare the value of the current iteration with the value from
# the last iteration. If they're equivalent than we skip. This works
# because the input array was sorted at the beginning, so all duplicates
# will be located adajently.
