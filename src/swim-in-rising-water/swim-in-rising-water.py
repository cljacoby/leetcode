'''
Key Insights:
    - First try pass a leetcode hard. Don't know if I've done that before.
      Based off leetcode's numbers, code seems mid-ish w.r.t runtime. 
      Seems to use a lot of memory. If I didn't declare tuple literals
      all over the place, that would probably help.
    - MinHeap as priority queue is like cheatcodes activated for some of
      these hard problems. I should probably assimilate how to write one
      from scratch for full understanding.
