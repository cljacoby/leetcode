/** 
 * Snag I was hitting was recognizing that you temporarily
 * set a single (idx,val) as both a max and a min, and rely on there
 * being a guaranteed solution (a!=b!=c!=d) to eventually resolve this.
 *
 * I was struggling with the idea that if we move out an old max,
 * don't we need to re-assess if it might be a new min? I think it's
 * possible to code it this way, it was just getting messy.
