'''
- Use a deque to represent s, and a list to represent p
- Create a frequency dict of initial character counts in s, and created
  a sorted array of the charactrs. 
- While there are still elements in either s or t, we pop an element
  from one. If t has no elements, always popleft on s. If t has
  elements, and the final value of t is smaller than the smallest
  remaining character in s (deduced by freq dict and sorted chars), then
  pop from t and append to p. Otherwise popleft from s and append to t.
- Whenever we popleft from s, decrement the frequency dict, and went a
  count hits zero, remove from the sorted array.
