# https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store

'''
Didn't read the instructions carefully, and missed the bullet point at
the bottom which stipulates values will be added with timestamps in
strictly increasing order.

So adding the heap of timestamped data is basically overkill. This
solution is still correct, and in fact has the advantage of still
working even if data is inserted in an unsorted order.

But as is it's really slow in leetcode cuz it does a bunch of extra
work.
