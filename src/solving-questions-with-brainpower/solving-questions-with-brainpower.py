Summary:
    1d array dynamic programming approach. Key is to iterate over array
    backwards to fill in results which exceed the array bounds, before
    getting to results which add to previous results.

Detailed:
    - Use a 1d array dynamic programming approach
    - Iterate over the array backwards
    - For each tuple, add `skip` to the current `index` and see if this
      index is within the array.
    - If out of bounds, update dp[i] to simply equal the current points
    - If in bounds, update dp[i] to the sum of the current question's
      points, plus the dp slot corresponding to index `skip + i + 11
