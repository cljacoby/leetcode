# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-good-subarrays

'''
two-pointers / sliding-window problem.

- Start by growing the right side of the window unti either
  we have a window good count >= k, or we reach the array end
- If we get a good count >= k, start shrinking the left side of the
  array. For every element we can pop off the left side, if the good
  count remains >= k, increment the return count
- The key is recognizing that any good sub-array found within the middle
  of the array can have all remaining numbers rightward of the window
  appended on and still be a good array. Therefore, when we increment
  count, we increment it as `count += n - right`
