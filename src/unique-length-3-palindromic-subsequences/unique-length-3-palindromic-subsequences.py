# https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences

'''
Had to reference others solutions on this one. I had the right idea of
building the index map. Where I went wrong was trying to iterate over
the first half of characters up to a midpoint testing each for a
palindrome.

The key insight was recognizing any 3 length palindrome will be specific
to characters with a count >= 2. Therefore, we can take all of these
instances, take the first and last index, slice the string, and count
the unique characters occuring within. Summing these together yields the
answer.
