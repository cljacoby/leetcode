# https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version

"""
This problem is basically just annoying scaffolding
around a binary search through an array. It's annoying
because the `isBadVersion(version)` is implemted on the
leetcode server side, so its harder to run/test locally.
"""

"""
Key Insights:
    - Don't need to create an array, because it's all just
      sequential integers from 1..N. So just pass values directly
      and don't index.
    - I'm still not that strong writing a binary search using indices
      rather than slices. I wrote a version with slices off the top of
      my head, but converting it to indices took some thinking. I should
      practice this.
