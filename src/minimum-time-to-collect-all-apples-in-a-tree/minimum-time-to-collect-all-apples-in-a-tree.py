# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree

'''
- Build a tree as a dict from `edges`, inserting both start->end and end->start
- Perform a DFS on the tree
- At each node, assess whether this node has an apple, or leads to a
  node which has an apple
- Add 2 for every node encountered which has an apple, and collect the
  total traversal length by adding result of each dfs() call
